Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview :
  This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival trends, and feature relationships. The goal is to gain insights from the data before building predictive models.

Key Steps in EDA :

1. Summary Statistics

  * Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, and missing values for all features.

2. Data Visualization

 * Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features to explore distributions and detect outliers.
 * Generated a correlation matrix and pairplots to analyze relationships between features.

3. Patterns, Trends & Anomalies

  * Observed survival trends by sex, passenger class, and family size.
  * Identified anomalies such as extreme fares and missing values in certain columns.

4. Feature-Level Insights

  * Females and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates.
  * Small families had better survival outcomes than very large or single passengers.
  * Children under 10 had higher survival probability.

5. Data Output

  * Processed dataset and visualizations were saved for further analysis or modeling.

Tools Used are : 

  * Python – pandas, numpy
  * Visualization – matplotlib, seaborn
  * Environment – Google Colab
